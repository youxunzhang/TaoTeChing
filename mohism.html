                            <p>
                                Mozi (c. 470-391 BCE) was born during the tumultuous Spring and Autumn period, a time of constant warfare and social inequality. Originally a craftsman and engineer, he became deeply troubled by the suffering he witnessed around him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike Confucius, who came from a noble background, Mozi was born into a family of craftsmen. This humble origin gave him a unique perspective on society and fueled his desire to create a more just and peaceful world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mozi's philosophy emerged as a direct challenge to the existing social order. He criticized the Confucian emphasis on ritual and family loyalty, arguing instead for universal love and merit-based advancement.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                            Mozi was once asked by a ruler: "Your doctrine of universal love is very difficult to practice. How can one love everyone equally?" Mozi replied with a simple analogy: "If your house is on fire, would you save your neighbor's child first, or your own child first?" The ruler said he would save his own child. Mozi then asked: "But if both houses were burning, and you could only save one child, would you choose based on whose child it was, or based on which child you could reach first?" This story illustrates that in emergencies, we naturally help those we can reach, regardless of their relationship to us.

                            <strong>Moral:</strong> Universal love means treating all people with the same care and concern we would show in a crisis, not favoring some over others based on personal connections.

                            When the state of Chu was preparing to attack the small state of Song, Mozi traveled for ten days and nights to reach Chu. He demonstrated to the Chu ruler that his attack would fail by showing how Song's defensive preparations would make the invasion costly and unsuccessful. The Chu ruler was impressed by Mozi's engineering skills and strategic thinking, and called off the attack. This story shows how Mozi used his practical skills to prevent war and save lives.

                            Mozi once advised a ruler who was choosing officials for his government. The ruler wanted to appoint his relatives and friends. Mozi asked: "If your house needed repairs, would you hire a skilled carpenter or your cousin who has never built anything?" The ruler said he would hire the skilled carpenter. Mozi then asked: "If you were sick, would you choose a qualified doctor or your friend who knows nothing about medicine?" The ruler again chose the qualified person. Mozi concluded: "Then why do you choose unqualified people to run your government, which is far more important than a house or your health?"

                            When Mozi was invited to a lavish banquet by a wealthy noble, he refused to eat the expensive dishes. The host asked why. Mozi explained: "I have seen people starving in the streets while you spend enough on one meal to feed a family for a month. How can I enjoy this luxury when others are suffering?" The noble was moved by Mozi's words and began to practice frugality, using his wealth to help the poor instead of indulging in extravagance.

                        Although Mohism declined after the Qin dynasty unified China, its influence persisted in various ways. The Mohist emphasis on universal love and non-aggression influenced later Chinese thought, including some aspects of Buddhism and certain strains of Confucianism.

                        Mohist ideas about meritocracy and opposition to hereditary privilege were revolutionary for their time and continue to resonate in modern discussions about social justice and equality. Their practical approach to problem-solving and emphasis on utility influenced Chinese engineering and technological development.

                        Today, Mohist principles of universal love, non-aggression, and concern for the common good remain relevant in our interconnected world. Their vision of a society based on merit rather than birth, and their commitment to peace and social welfare, continue to inspire those seeking a more just and harmonious world.
